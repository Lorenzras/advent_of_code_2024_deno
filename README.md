# ADVENT OF CODE 2024

This is my attempt to solve the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) using Deno/TypeScript.

Solutions are based on what I came up with when riding the train to work or late night gaming, so they might not be the most optimal solutions.

I add non-relevant comments along side the code to help me remember what I was thinking at the time.

In other words, this is not a tutorial, but a diary. XD

## Environment

Deno is used to run the code. You can install it by following the instructions on the [Deno website](https://deno.land/).

## Testing

To run the test, I use the following command:

Example:

```bash
deno test --allow-read src/day_01/part_01.test.ts
```

If using VSCode, built-in test runner can be used.
